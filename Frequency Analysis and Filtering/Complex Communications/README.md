# Complex Communications
### Introduction
While the [Tradtional Communications](https://github.com/QueenSophiaLo/MATLAB-Circuits-Projects/tree/main/Frequency%20Analysis%20and%20Filtering/Traditional%20Communications) problem  uses only real signals, modern communication systems typically use complex signals. This problem provides an audio signal composed of two audio signals merged into one. One audio signal is contained in the real part of the signal while the other is contained in the imaginary part.
